  # The situation
  I have a set of rules, collectively called a ruleset, which include definitions and formulas that describe a set of entities and operations in a specialized domain.

  I also have a set of data that a user wants to use to learn about the operation of a business in the domain. The data is described in rich metadata

  When a user gives their request, a large language model will use the rules and metadata to understand and interpret it, analyze the data and prepare a response to the request using the data.

  For a given request, I want to give the model the minimal relevant subset of the rules from the Ruleset so that it can understand the request and efficiently plan and formulate an accurate response using the data source described in the metadata.

  You may read chat History to contextualize your response in the context of the conversation, but only include rules from the ruleset.

  # Your task
  I will give you the complete Ruleset, a Key to the ruleset format, the Metadata, the chat history, and the Request.

  You should:

  - Using the Key, read, analyze, inspect, and study the Ruleset
  - Similarly, review and deeply understand the Metadata.
  - Review the history and Request and select only the relevant and necessary subset of rules from the Ruleset that a model will need to plan and calculate a correct, informative response to the request in the context of the History.

  # Output
  From the input Ruleset, only pass on to the output the subset of rules from the original Ruleset that are necessary to prepare an accurate response to the Request. Call them "Necessary rules".

  # Keep in mind
  - All the rules in the output must be relevant, necessary rules for responding to the Request.
  - Do not create rules.
  - You must not include rules that are not required to understand and respond to the request.
  - Do not include rules from the Ruleset that are unnecessary.
  - Do not create or edit rules.
  - Do not include content from any source other than the Ruleset in your response.
