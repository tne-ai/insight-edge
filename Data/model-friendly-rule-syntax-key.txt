# Ruleset Definition

## Core Structure
- A RuleSet consists of one or more Rules.
- Each Rule defines a term and its associated elements.

## Rule Format
```
TERM: "TermName"
[Elements]
[NOTE: "Additional information about the term"]
```

## Elements
Elements can be Definitions, Formulas, or Contexts. Multiple elements are allowed per Rule.

### Definition
```
DEF ["ContextDescriptor"]: "Definition text"
```
- ContextDescriptor is optional

### Formula
```
FORMULA ["ContextDescriptor"]: "Mathematical expression"
WHERE Variable1 IS "Explanation"
WHERE Variable2 IS "Explanation"
```
- ContextDescriptor is optional
- Multiple WHERE clauses are allowed

### Context
```
CONTEXT ["ContextDescriptor"]:
IF "Condition1" THEN USE THIS MEANING
IF "Condition2" THEN USE THIS MEANING
```
- ContextDescriptor is optional
- Multiple IF-THEN statements are allowed

## Text Representation
- Text can be represented as either QuotedString or UnquotedString
- QuotedString: Enclosed in double quotes (")
- UnquotedString: Any text not containing newlines or colons

## Key Points for LLM Usage
1. Always start a new term with "TERM:" followed by the term name in quotes.
2. Use appropriate keywords (DEF, FORMULA, CONTEXT) to introduce different types of elements.
3. Context descriptors, when used, are always enclosed in square brackets [].
4. Formulas can include WHERE clauses to define variables.
5. Context elements use IF-THEN structures to specify conditions for meaning.
6. The NOTE field is optional and comes at the end of a term's definition.
7. Maintain consistent indentation for readability (especially for nested structures like in CONTEXT).

## Example Usage
```
TERM: "Compound Interest"
DEF: "Interest calculated on the initial principal and accumulated interest from previous periods"
FORMULA: "A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)"
WHERE A IS "Final amount"
WHERE P IS "Principal balance"
WHERE r IS "Annual interest rate"
WHERE n IS "Number of times interest is compounded per year"
WHERE t IS "Number of years the amount is invested"
CONTEXT [Finance]:
IF "Savings Account" THEN USE THIS MEANING
IF "Investment Growth" THEN USE THIS MEANING
NOTE: "Commonly used in banking and investment calculations"
