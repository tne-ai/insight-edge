Original columns: demand_plan_description, product_hier_feature_1_desc, product_group_description, product_subgroup_desc, style_colour_desc, gender, style_colour_code, period, client_id, region_id, range_segment, material, product_launch_date, colour_description, channel_cid, distinct_store_count, pareto, month, season, sales, beg_inv, end_inv, total_stock, dc_inv, weeks_selling, standard_selling_price, standard_cost_price, aur, margin  v, margin %, sales v, discount v, discount %, price_metric
Number of rows: 970

# IMPORTANT
-When calculating total discount value, you MUST not use 'msrp'. Instead, use AUR.
-When filtering data within a specified timeframe (e.g., "the last 3 months"), ensure the filtering operation applies directly to the entire dataset before any other conditional filtering (like product category). This prevents losing relevant date information and captures the true global maximum.
-Avoid filtering by category or subgroup before determining the relevant date range.

# The meanings of columns in the  data:
period: Month of reported sales and inventory for the row. The format is YYYYMM, so 202202 is February of 2022.
sales: Unit sales for the specified product during the month specified in 'period'
total_stock: end_inv + sales, ONLY FOR A SINGLE PERIOD.
end_inv: the ending inventory for the style-color for the period. This is the default field to use for questions regarding "inventory" for a product and period

# Important information about the data schema:
- There is a 1:1 mapping between 'style_colour_description' and 'style_colour_code'. Those two are two equivalent identifiers for a style_color.
- One 'style_colour_code' can appear in multiple rows. Among those rows, the period, sales, and inventory information is likely to vary.
- Each row presents sales and inventory information for its 'style_colour_code' in the month noted in the row's 'period' column.
- To get total sales for a style_color, total the 'sales' in all the rows for various 'periods' for that style_color.
- To detect and describe trends in unit sales and inventory for a style_color, analyse its 'sales' growing or shrinking over time, as time passes (the 'period' increases).
- To answer simple, direct questions about a product's sales or inventory that don't specify aggregation or comparison
among periods, use the total sales, ROS, and inventory for the most recent period available for the product.
- In this data set, no terms refer to a specific brand. Requests for this data set are more likely to refer to categories or subcategories.
- When asked about a product using a five-digit number, like "Style 36697", search for the numeric part (36697) in the style_colour_desc column using an approximate match like "in", "contains", or "like".
- The column 'style_colour_code' is not useful to return to the user without additional context. Instead, return columns such as 'style_colour_desc' or 'product_subgroup_desc' UNLESS EXPLICITLY TOLD BY THE USER.
- discount is (standard_selling_price - aur) * sales. Discount can be summed for a group of products or for a product over time. Do NOT use MSRP to calculate discount.
- All the data in this data source is about handbags. The product_subgroup_desc is the style_colour's subcategory within handbags
IMPORTANT: When you see 'Handbag', this term encompasses ALL DATA IN THE CORPUS. ALL THE PRODUCTS are 'Handbag'. DO NOT QUERY OR FILTER USING 'Handbag'
