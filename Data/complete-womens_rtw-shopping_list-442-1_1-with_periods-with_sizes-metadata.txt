# Schema notes for womens_rtw-shopping_list-442-1_1-with_periods-with_sizes_cleaned.csv

## Descriptions of column meaning in the  data:
period: Month of reported sales for the row. The format is YYYYMM, so 202202 is February of 2022.
sales: unit sales for the specified product during the month specified in 'period'

## Important information about calculating using the data schema:
### Product hierarchy and identity
- All the products in the data are women's clothing
- The top level grouping column is "product_hier_feature_1_desc", then 'product_group_description', then 'product_subgroup_desc', then style_color as either 'style_color_description' or 'style_color_id'
- A 'sku_id' is determined by a 'style_color_id' combined with a specific 'size_code'
- When asked about a product using a seven-digit number, like "5226727", it is a 'sku_id'.
- There is a 1:1 mapping between 'style_color_description' and 'style_color_id'. Those are two equivalent identifiers for a style_color.

- One style_color can appear in multiple rows. Among those rows, the size, period, and sales information will vary.
- Each row presents sales information for its 'sku_id' in the month noted in the row's 'period' column.

- Discount is ('standard selling price' - 'aur') * sales . Discount can be total for a group of style_colors, a product over time, or both. Do NOT use 'msrp' to calculate discount.

### Sales
- To get total sales for a style_color or sku_id, total the 'sales' in all the rows for that style_color or sku_id.
- To detect and describe trends in unit sales for a style_color or sku, analyse its 'sales' growing or shrinking over time.
- To answer simple, direct questions about sales for a style_color or sku_id that don't specify a specific period, aggregation or comparison among periods, sum 'sales' over all periods available.
- To get total sales for a style_color or sku, total the 'sales' in all the rows for various 'period's for that style_color.
- To detect and describe trends in unit sales for a style_color, analyse its 'sales' growing or shrinking over time.
- To answer simple, direct questions about a product's sales that don't specify aggregation or comparison
among periods, use 'sales' for the most recent period available for the product.

### Other notes about presentation and calculation
- In this data set, no terms refer to a specific brand. Requests for this data set are more likely to refer to categories or subcategories.
- Unless explicitly directed by the user, don't use the numerical column 'style_color_id' in a response without additional context. Instead, return textual columns such as 'style_color_description' or 'product_subgroup_desc'
- Because of the data format, you cannot extract information from the 'period' column with the method df['period'].str.endswith(). Instead, use pd.to_datetime() to extract this information.
- REMEMBER: 'sells well', 'top', 'what want people want to buy' are referring to the 'sales' column, NOT ROS. DO NOT calculate ROS in response to these types of questions.
